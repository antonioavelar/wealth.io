# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload broker files (such as CSV, PDF, or Excel files) from various brokers and automatically parse them to create transactions within their portfolio. The system will extract transaction data from these files, validate the information, and create corresponding transaction records in the user's portfolio, eliminating the need for manual data entry.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want to upload broker files from my trading accounts, so that I can automatically import my transaction history without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a broker file to upload THEN the system SHALL accept common file formats (CSV, PDF, Excel)
2. WHEN a user uploads a file larger than 10MB THEN the system SHALL reject the file with an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user uploads a file with an unsupported format THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message listing supported formats
4. IF the file upload is successful THEN the system SHALL proceed to the parsing stage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want the system to automatically detect my broker format, so that I don't need to manually specify which broker the file comes from.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a broker file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL attempt to automatically detect the broker format based on file structure and content
2. WHEN the system detects a supported broker format THEN the system SHALL display the detected broker name for user confirmation
3. IF the broker format cannot be automatically detected THEN the system SHALL display an error message indicating the file format is not supported
4. IF the user confirms the detected broker THEN the system SHALL proceed with parsing using the appropriate broker mapping

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want the system to parse my broker file and extract transaction data, so that all my trades are accurately captured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a broker file is being parsed THEN the system SHALL extract transaction details including date, symbol, quantity, price, transaction type, and fees
2. WHEN parsing encounters invalid or missing data THEN the system SHALL log the specific errors and continue processing valid transactions
3. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing total transactions found, successfully parsed, and any errors encountered
4. IF no valid transactions are found THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message explaining possible causes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want to review parsed transactions before they are added to my portfolio, so that I can verify the accuracy of the imported data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transaction parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview table showing all parsed transactions
2. WHEN displaying the preview THEN the system SHALL highlight any transactions with potential issues or missing data
3. WHEN a user reviews the preview THEN the system SHALL allow them to edit individual transaction details before importing
4. WHEN a user confirms the import THEN the system SHALL create the transactions in the specified portfolio

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want the system to handle duplicate transactions intelligently, so that I don't accidentally import the same trades multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing transactions THEN the system SHALL check for potential duplicates based on date, symbol, quantity, and price
2. WHEN potential duplicates are detected THEN the system SHALL display them to the user with options to skip, merge, or import as separate transactions
3. WHEN a user chooses to skip duplicates THEN the system SHALL exclude them from the import process
4. IF no duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL proceed with importing all transactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want to see the progress of file processing, so that I know the system is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is being processed THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing current stage (upload, parsing, validation)
2. WHEN processing large files THEN the system SHALL show percentage completion where possible
3. WHEN processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL display error messages without stopping the overall process
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a final summary with success/failure counts

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a portfolio user, I want the system to support multiple broker formats, so that I can import data regardless of which broker I use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL support parsing files from at least 3 major brokers (extending existing XTB, Binance, Coinbase support)
2. WHEN a new broker format needs to be added THEN the system SHALL allow for easy extension through configuration or mapping files
3. WHEN parsing different broker formats THEN the system SHALL normalize the data to a consistent internal format
4. IF a broker format is not supported THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on supported formats and how to request new ones
